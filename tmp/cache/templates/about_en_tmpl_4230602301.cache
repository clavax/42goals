    <h1>What is 42goals?</h1>
    <p>
        42goals is a project of a small team who has brought you <a href="http://worktrek.com">the Worktrek</a>.
        Our mission is to help people in achieving their goals and organizing their life.
        We work in different fields but all of us needed such a service to help in concentrating on our daily activities such as study and working.
        That's why we have created 42goals.
